# Bend2 - Work in Progress

Bend combines all my former work into one final language to "rule them all".

It has several goals:

## Target *everything*: GPUs, CPUs, Web, HVM

Most GPU languages, like CUDA, are low-level, C-like, based on buffers and
matrixes. Bend2 is the first GPU-targetting language that includes modern
featuers like first-class functions, unrestricted recursion and fast object
allocation. But it also targets CPU (via Haskell), web (via JS), and, obviously,
the HVM (for optimal Î»-Calculus evaluation).

## Maximal AI Automation

Bend is designed, from scratch, to be used by AIs, aiming to become the most
automated language in the world. This includes features like dependency tree
injection (generating small, complete contexts for the LLMs) and auto-repair of
LLM mistakes (via NeoGen theorem prover).

## A Powerful Proof Assistant

Bend is, like Lean and Kind, a proof assistant capable of stating and verifying
mathematical theorems. Its type-checker is very fast, and includes modern
features like observational equality, making it ergonomic for proving work.
