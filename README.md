# Bend2 - Work in Progress

Bend2 aims to combine all my previous work into one language to rule them all:

- Parallel Evaluation (via [HVM3-Strict](https://github.com/higherorderco/hvm3))

- Optimal Evaluation (via [HVM3-Lazy](https://github.com/higherorderco/hvm3))

- A Proof Verifier (superseding [Kind](https://github.com/HigherOrderCO/Kind))

- A Proof Generator (watch the [NeoGen Demo](https://x.com/VictorTaelin/status/1881392823246729640))

It is also built, from scratch, aiming *full AI automation*. I'll be writing
more about this in the future. For now, I'll leave this repo up as a WIP.
