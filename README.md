# Bend2 - Work in Progress

Bend is many things, some of which may interest you.

**A High-Level GPU Language**

Bend is the only true high-level language that runs natively on GPUs. Most
alternatives, like CUDA, are very low-level, C-like, and don't offer modern
features like closures, recursion, or a fast object allocator. Bend does that.

**Unprecedented Automation**

Bend is the first programming language built for the AI era. It includes the
world's fastest algorithm synthesizer, which means the compiler infers parts of
your code, including complete algorithms, for you.

**A Powerful Proof Assistant**

Bend doubles as a proof assistant capable of stating and verifying mathematical
theorems. Its type-checker is very fast, and includes modern features like
observational equality, making it very convenient for formalization.

**The Culmination of my Work**

For these familiar with my work, Bend2 combines it all - Kind, HVM3-Strict,
HVM3-Lazy, Bend and NeoGen (an automated program synthesizer) into a single
language to rule them all. It will be actively developed.

**THIS REPOSITORY IS A WORK IN PROGRESS**
